Hi, I'm Mahmoud , And this is my first fully implemented project which is a simple game using c# that it's name is Flappy Bird which is a bird that must pass the pipes to take points and increse it's score.
When You Clone This Project There Is a File That It's Name Is Play-Mode , As Remember I Didn't Use It But I Forgot To Remove it 
So Have Fun :)
